\subsection{Equipment Class}

In order to perform classification of equipment correctly, users can create equipment classes. Possible equipment classes are hose pipe, ladder, lamp, etc. When creating a new equipment class, users have to fill in its title without white spaces and activity status, as well as its description, as displayed on \hyperref[sections/equipment/images/Fig.1]{Fig.~\ref*{sections/equipment/images/Fig.1}}.

Users can search for existing equipment classes either by specifying title, which is auto-completed, or activity status, or both, as displayed on \hyperref[sections/equipment/images/Fig.2]{Fig.~\ref*{sections/equipment/images/Fig.2}}.
