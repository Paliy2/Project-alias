\section{Forms Module}\label{sec:01}

Forms allow users to perform a daily checkup of the equipment, assigned to them. A new Form Equipment can be added in the "Form Item" folder. A "Form" is currently under development, but it will contain a Collection of the "Form Items". A User can change the status (Accepted or not) of the Form Item on the Form Class web page. Every Form has the Status property.
